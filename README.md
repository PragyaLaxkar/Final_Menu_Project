# 🚀 Final_Menu_Project

Welcome to the **Final_Menu_Project** repository! This project is a comprehensive, menu-driven application that integrates a variety of tasks and technologies from software development and cloud computing domains. It’s a hands-on, practical tool designed to help you master essential skills across multiple areas.

## 📚 Overview

This project is organized as a multi-functional tool, where each menu option corresponds to a distinct task in a specific area of expertise. The menu-driven interface allows you to easily navigate through and work on tasks related to:

- 🎨 **Frontend Development:** Create responsive and dynamic UIs using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS.
- 🐍 **Python Programming:** Develop scripts for automation, data manipulation, and API integration.
- 🤖 **GenAIops:** Automate and optimize workflows by integrating AI with DevOps practices.
- 🐳 **Docker:** Containerize applications to ensure consistent behavior across different environments, supporting microservices architecture.
- 🌐 **Full Stack Development:** Build a complete web application stack including frontend (ReactJS), backend (Node.js, Express), and database management (MongoDB, MySQL).
- 🗄️ **Databases:** Perform CRUD operations, execute complex queries, and design databases for SQL and NoSQL systems.
- 🐧 **Linux Operations:** Execute shell scripting, manage system administration tasks, and handle network management on Linux.
- ☁️ **AWS Services:** Leverage AWS cloud services for deployment, storage, and computing, integrating tools like EC2, S3, Lambda, and more.

## 🎯 Purpose

This project serves as the capstone of my learning journey, showcasing my ability to integrate and apply knowledge across various domains. It’s designed to be a versatile toolkit that not only supports educational purposes but also provides practical, real-world solutions.

## 🛠️ Project Deployment

The project is deployed on an Apache HTTP server hosted on an AWS instance. Below are the steps to deploy this project:

### Launch an AWS Instance:

- Start an instance on AWS, ensuring that HTTP, HTTPS, and all necessary traffic are allowed.
- Access the instance as the root user.

### Install Apache HTTP Server:

`yum install httpd`  
`systemctl start httpd`  
`systemctl enable httpd
`

### Install Python Dependencies:

`
yum install python3-pip`  
`pip install twilio google-generativeai geopy paramiko boto3 requests beautifulsoup4 secure-smtplib gtts  
`

### Set Up Docker:

`
yum install docker`  
`systemctl start docker`  
`systemctl enable docker  
`

### Enable SSL/TLS Encryption:

Install the `mod_ssl` package for SSL/TLS encryption on the server with:

`
yum install mod_ssl
`

This ensures secure HTTPS connections, enhancing the security of your deployed application.
